# Timbiriche (Dots and Boxes) Game

Welcome to our Timbiriche game project repository! In this project, we have implemented the classic game of Timbiriche, also known as Dots and Boxes. Apart from being able to play the game against another player, we've also implemented the functionality to play against a computer player, with varying difficulty levels. The hardest difficulty level is designed to be impossible to beat!

## Features

- Challenge yourself by playing against a computer player.
- Choose from different difficulty levels for the computer player, ranging from easy to impossible.
- Enjoy a clean and intuitive user interface for an enhanced gaming experience.
